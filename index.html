        <p> Ahir or Aheer is a community in South Asia, According to the researches (till 1914) made by Shrotriya Pandit Chotelal Sharma of Phulera, Rajasthan – Ahir clan had 1768 or more variants (gotra) & subsets in it.
            According to the Markandeya Purana, all the Haiheya aggressors (warrior caste) were killed in a massacre led by Parshuram. In that time, the Ahirs were either a sub-clan of the Hayheya or sided with the Hayheya.</p>

            <p>Many historians considers the Ahir to be a tribe descended from the ancient Abhira community. Etymologically, who can cast terror on all sides is called an Abhira. In Sanskrit, A is a prefix to imply opposite of
            any word and bhīru(भीरु) means afraid.</p>

           <p> The sociologist M. S. A. Rao and historians such as P. M. Chandorkar and T. Padmaja say that epigraphical and historical evidence exists for equating the Ahirs with the ancient Yadava tribe
            According to Jayant Gadkari tribes such as Varsni, Andhaka, Satvatas and Abhiras after a period of long conflicts came to be known as Yadavas.</p>

           <p>In the Padma-puranas and certain literary works, the Abhiras are referred to as belonging to the race of Krishna.
            There is no certainty regarding the occupational status of the Abhiras, with ancient texts sometimes referring to them as warriors, pastoral and cowherders but at other times as plundering tribes.</p>

           <p>In archaeological inscriptions Abhiras are mentioned as belonging to the race of Lord Krishna.  According to K. P. Jayaswal the Abhiras of Gujarat are the same race as Rastrikas of Emperor Asoka and Yadavas of the Mahabharatha.</p>

            <p>The Puranic Abhiras occupied the territories of Herat; they are invariably juxtaposed with the Kalatoyakas and Haritas, the peoples of Afghanistan.
            From 203 to 270 the Abhiras ruled over the whole of the Deccan Plateau as a paramount power. The Abhiras were the immediate successors of the Satavahanas.</p>
